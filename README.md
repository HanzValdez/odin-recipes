# odin-recipes
This is my first assignment on The Odin Project titled "Recipes". The purpose of this assignment is to create a webpage showcasing various recipes using HTML.
The skills I will be demonstrating is fundamentals of Git, HTML and documenting along the way to show progress.
<!--Don’t forget everything we went over in the previous lesson about commit messages!

When you’re building your project, you will probably end up doing several git add + git commit cycles before being ready to push it up to GitHub with git push origin main.

When writing code, it’s considered best practice to commit early and often. Commit every time you have a meaningful change in the code. This will create a timeline of your progress and show that your finished code didn’t appear out of nowhere.

After you have entered git push origin main, switch over to your browser and open your repository on GitHub. You should now see all the files you just pushed.

Okay, that’s enough Git for the moment – time to actually build stuff!-->
