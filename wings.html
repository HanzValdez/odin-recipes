        <p><li>Use tongs to transfer wings out of sauce and place on the preheated grill; cook until lightly charred on both sides, about 8 to 10 minutes, then return wings to the sauce to continue cooking. Repeat this process until chicken is cooked and pulls easily off of the bone, and the sauce is hot and thickened, about 50 minutes. You can serve them as sloppy-style wings, or serve right off the grill for dryer wings and dip!</li></p>
